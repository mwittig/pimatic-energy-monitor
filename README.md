# pimatic-energy-monitor

Pimatic plugin which accumulates the electric energy consumption of PowerSwitch devices and and power meters.

For example a spotlight device using 20W has been activated for 6 hours until now:
- Calculate Consumption: A spotlight using 20W * 6 activated hours = 120Wh or 0,120kWh until now
- Calculate Cost: 0,120kWh * €0,23 energy price per kWh = €0,0276 until now (* 365 days = €10,074 cost per year)
